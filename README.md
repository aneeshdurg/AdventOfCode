# Advent Of Code

This repo contains my AoC solutions

## Day 1

Got stuck on part 2 because I was computing the fuel required for the total fuel
required of all components (the part 1 solution) instead of computing the fuel
for every component individually. I learned to read the questions more
carefully.

## Day 2

Pretty straightforward, spent some time trying to cleanup my code and make it
more idiomatic. Using `?` instead of some `match` statements really helped!
