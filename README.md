# Advent Of Code

This repo contains my AoC solutions

## Day 1

Got stuck on part 2 because I was computing the fuel required for the total fuel
required of all components (the part 1 solution) instead of computing the fuel
for every component individually. I learned to read the questions more
carefully.

## Day 2

Pretty straightforward, spent some time trying to cleanup my code and make it
more idiomatic. Using `?` instead of some `match` statements really helped!

## Day 3

I tried to think of a solution better than O(mn) but I couldn't come up with
anything substantially better. I caved and went with the obvious solution in the
end. It wasn't a total loss, because I still got to improve my familiarity with
Rust's datastructures and syntax around iterators in the process.

I did intially mis-interpret the question and assumed that the only possible
intersection points were on the "corners" of the wires, but I caught that pretty
early on.
